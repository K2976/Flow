# Flow
**Master your focus. Manage your cognitive load.**

Flow is a beautifully designed macOS application created to help you understand and manage your digital attention. In today's world of constant notifications and rapid app-switching, it's easy to become overwhelmed. Flow acts as your personal cognitive dashboard, smoothly guiding you back to a state of deep work and calm.

## How It Works
At the heart of Flow is the **Cognitive Load Engine**, which continuously calculates and tracks your focus state in real-time. 

- **The Focus Orb**: A dynamic, interactive widget on your screen that visually represents your current cognitive state. When you are focused and calm, the orb is relaxed. As distractions pile up, the orb visually reflects your growing "cognitive load" or mental fatigue.
- **Attention Events**: Flow intelligently detects activities that fracture your focus—like rapid app switching, prolonged idle time, or interacting with notifications. It tracks these as "Attention Events" and gently visualizes their impact on your mental bandwidth.
- **Focus Mode**: When the orb shows you're getting overwhelmed, entering Focus Mode helps you step back. Flow provides an immersive, distraction-free environment that accelerates your cognitive recovery, helping your mental load decay back down to a calm baseline.
- **Session Tracking**: After a work session, review your focus history and "peak cognitive load" to understand your working patterns, recognize your triggers, and build healthier digital habits.

## Key Features
- **Real-Time Distraction Detection**: Monitors realistic macOS workspace events to quietly identify when your attention is drifting.
- **Immersive Feedback**: Uses subtle haptics and audio cues to provide immediate physical awareness when an attention-breaking event occurs.
- **Visual Analytics**: A beautiful dashboard and history strip to visualize your cognitive load over the last 20 minutes and across different work sessions.
- **Simulation & Demo Mode**: Built-in demonstration capabilities to easily simulate focus and distraction patterns without needing real-world interruptions.

Whether you're studying for a difficult exam, writing complex code, or simply trying to work without interruption, **Flow** is designed to make you aware of your cognitive limits and help you effortlessly return to your center.
